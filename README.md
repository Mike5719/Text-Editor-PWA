# Text-Editor-PWA

## Description:

Here you will find a text editor that runs in the browser. This app is a single page application that meets the PWA criteria. This PWA can function both online and offline and features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The PWA uses the `idb` package for storing and retrieving data from an IndexedDB database.

## Installation:

To install the app the user must open an integrated CLI at the root of the directory. I in the CLI simply type `NPM i` and after all dependencies have been installed, start the application by typing `NPM start` in the CLI. Finally, right click the index.html file in the client/dist folder and select "Open with Live Server" from the list of options. This will take you to the Text-Editor landing page.
